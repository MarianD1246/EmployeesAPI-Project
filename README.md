# EmployeesAPI-Project
Week6 Group Project

Build a REST API application for the Northwind database.
Your API should expose useful information and functionality around either Customers (group 1) or Employees (group 2)

Think carefully about what data you want your users to be able to retrieve, and how your will structure the endpoint urls.  Who is the user and what information do they need? What should they be able to do?

Be sure to handle errors - if the user enters an invalid parameter, what should be returned?

Use DTOs to return the desired information for each call

Your User Story Definition of Done of should include testing of the functionality using Postman.

Use Scrum (a single backlog/sprint) for project management.

Use  GitHub (private repo) for both the repo and the project board and provide a README

By the end of Wednesday 30th March 3.30pm, we will have a review. I want to see an up to date project board, and the DoD for the project.

Your application could also include
SwaggerUI documentation 
Use of Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State (HATEOAS)
Unit testing of the controller methods (you will need to mock the Repository interface)

Deadline is Friday 1st April 4pm. At 4pm there will be a technical review, where you will explain what your API does, who the users of your API will be, what information can you request from the API (why will this be relevant to the user), demonstrate some requests (using postman or swagger), a retrospective.
